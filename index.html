        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economicsüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Yiming Xuzhou is a second-year economics major who is interested in the intersection of entrepreneurship, marketing, and software engineering. Currently, he attends the University of California, Riverside and studies remotely from Silicon Valley, California. Yiming‚Äôs academic interests range from computer science, philosophy, and business. As a CodeAcademy student, Yiming has already had a taste of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since high school, Yiming has maintained a firm curiosity for why and how the world works which led to his attraction towards philosophy. Yiming became fascinated with business since he grew up in the center of innovative technology companies. In this area, failure is seen as a rite of passage, and Yiming‚Äôs dream to own a collection of brands and businesses is not one that will be easy the first time. In addition to these aspirations, Yiming also enjoys many hobbies and simple joys. This includes concert-going, basketball, nature walks, and long drives to new places.<br><br>

        
        As the Chief Marketing Officer for oneboard, a tech startup, Yiming has partnered with innovation advisors from UCI‚Äôs wayfinder incubator, CEOs, and marketing directors from research universities such as the California Institute of Technology. Yiming understands the true driving force behind an online consumer‚Äôs decision to pay for a software membership--and it does not come from viewing a new trendy advertisement. It‚Äôs how the service provides a clear and sustained advantage over the competition when addressing an identified problem. Yiming works to present scalable and constantly evolving services to the consumers in a way that makes the user say ‚ÄúHey! I need this.‚Äù<br><br>

        oneboard is a document sharing website for real-time online whiteboards. Built as a solution for educators caught in an era of online learning, the aim of oneboard is to allow for teachers to share entire lessons through a streaming whiteboard while giving students all the tools to feel as if they were in the same classroom as the teacher. This includes being able to annotate directly onto a teacher‚Äôs presentation, being able to view parts of the presentation that the teacher may have passed, and several other benefits. On top of this, oneboard is built to be shared and networked as easily as one can do on a social media platform. The end vision for our company is to become a one-stop social networking platform that brings together educators, students, and creators.<br><br>
        
        In addition to being a marketing strategist, Yiming works as a sole proprietorship DBA and as subcontractor/project manager in his free time. By overseeing the business side of an industrial maintenance firm that works for pharmaceutical superpower Bayer Healthcare, Yiming has learned the importance of being dependable, communicable, and hard working. His current position tasks him with a repertoire of responsibilities; This ranges from coordinating jobs for other subcontractors, receiving and sending out invoices, Quickbooks Accounting work, and following up with engineers and supervisors. Working directly under a full-time contractor with over 30 years of experience, Yiming views the job as an effective apprenticeship for learning how to run a company.<br><br>
